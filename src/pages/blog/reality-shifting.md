  A new trend, that I unexpectedly followed.

There's a new trend on Tik Tok about "Reality Shifting" and I was surprised to learn about it then immediately think "wait... this is something I regularly do". If you are not up to speed, the primarily Gen Z populous on Tik Tok have been purporting the act of Reality Shifting as a method of transporting consciousness into a lucid dream-like state.

One of the strategies I employed to learn software engineering at an extremely efficient pace was that I would meditate prior to sleeping and immediately after practicing a hard concept. I would then go to sleep and continue to study in a lucid dream-like state which people are calling "reality shifting". I would wake up with a strengthened skill, and feel significantly more confident with the newly honed skill.

My theory about the functionality of this process has to do with how dreams are understood to be related to subconscious memory processing. In software language, your studying is to programming as your memory retention is to your developer environment. The lucid dreaming is like the build script, and the result is that you wake up with a minified bundle of retained knowledge.
