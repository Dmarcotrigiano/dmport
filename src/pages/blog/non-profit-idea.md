I'm thinking of starting a non-profit tech firm which would act as a mentor/apprenticeship program for underserved areas. With shelter inflation projected to see a 4% year after year increase despite other types of inflation looking to correct, people need skills that sell. The amount of work in tech right now is mind blowing, and people that I currently mentor could probably do the work I'm getting with assistance or guidance.

Underserved areas being able to acquire high paying remote jobs, preferably from local establishments (win-win) looking to get the incentive of tax credits, local economies may benefit. The new high-paid skilled workers will see benefits in buying locally, as local businesses are their clients.

Another massive benefit of this endeavor is the dissuasive nature with respect to college. I have grown to believe that society has fallen victim to multi-generation long marketing campaign to sell the American dream via college education. Young adults are being bound to thousands of dollars in student loans that increase year after year. These increases are not commensurate with education quality, not even mentioning job preparedness. With tech, education is not considered as a standard, but as a token that shows basic character traits like discipline, ability to complete a task. These character traits can be shown in many other medium than a diploma, without the debt.
