I was hired by Kevin as a consultant to provide insight on the details involved with a migration from an outdated Node JS webpage, to a WordPress site. I was to decipher whether it is the best decision for their non-profit organization. While I am confident in my Node JS skillset, the work involved with updating the site compared to the needs by the organization were not in alignment. I could not see the merit of expensive maintainence costs for an organization which does not have extraordinary needs. As a result, I instructed Kevin to seek out a professional who may provide their non-profit organization with a lean WordPress site that yields less maintainence liability.

"Daniel was a gem to work with. I can't speak highly enough of him. I was looking to get a code audit done for a small non-profit organization that had an overly complex website written in Node JS 3 years ago. We were pretty clueless. We had gotten all different kinds of proposals. Daniel really simplified things for us and thought we would be better served by a simpler website even if they aren't the right one to do the job. In my opinion, the sign of a great businessperson is when they know what jobs not to take but they can still be helpful anyway. I would highly recommend him for your JS development needs. That is his specialty." - Kevin B.
