Before meeting Daniel, I was a self-taught student of over two years without direction, struggling with impostor syndrome. I understood logic and a fair amount of syntax, but the idea of building real-world applications seemed like a distant and nearly insurmountable task. With Danielâ€™s guidance, my horizons and confidence have since expanded dramatically.

Daniel helped me take my first steps into JavaScript. Through hands-on instruction into a number of useful modules and frameworks, he helped me grasp the core concepts of web design not only as a technical skill set, but also as a discipline. And he helped me compile all of this new knowledge into a more complete understanding that had previously eluded me.

Most importantly, Daniel gave me the chance to put my newfound skills to work in the real world. By working alongside him on a number of freelance projects, he gave me a fresh perspective into the realities of doing business with clients and delivering on a deadline. It was during these experiences that I grew the most.

A mentor is an invaluable resource to have. From learning languages to learning to conduct yourself as a professional, there is no better way to meet your goals than to get your feet wet under the guidance of someone on the front lines who has been where you are. But it is important to find the right mentor; someone who earnestly believes and invests in you. After meeting Daniel, for the first time since I began my coding journey, I can confidently call myself a web developer.
