During this project I had to onboard quickly as analytics were being impacted drastically due to diagnosed duplicate event errors. The client, Andrew, was using Google Tag Manager which was a technology I had not worked with before, however, before accepting the offer I conducted research on the program and found that the documentation was thorough enough for me to utilize with no delay.

Deduplication issues are often caused by the event not having a universally unique identifier or UUID associated with it. This prevents the advertising software from disambiguating two events which may have the same format, but are discrete events from two customers. Naturally this is of large concern to advertisers in a evermore competitive market, and this was what I resolved for my client. I then explained the issue, and how to prevent such issues from arising in the future.

Andrew left me the following review:

"Daniel was great to work with. Right out of the gate he worked to understand the issue, research the appropriate fix and implement in a timely solution. He was very good with communicating his work and explaining the issues/updates to a more “non-technical” person, like myself. I’d highly recommend him for any development work. Will be working with him again!" -Andrew M.
