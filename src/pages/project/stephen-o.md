SteveO had hired me to audit the integration of SendGrid, and to make sure the software was working as expected. I elucidated the fact that Double Opt-in marketing was not functioning as expected, and clarified how one would implement such a feature.

He left me this review:

"A total pleasure to work with Daniel. He came in well under budget and completed the job successfully. His communication skills were above what I expected. After the job completed he explained each step he took and then made recommendations to get the most out of the service I was using. Very impressed." -Stephen O.
